## Abstract
An interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyse road accident data, uncover patterns, and generate actionable insights for road safety improvement.

## Project Overview
The dataset includes information on accident severity, vehicle types, road conditions, and casualty counts. This dashboard leverages Excel’s data analysis and visualization features to identify key trends, improve decision-making, and support strategies for reducing road accidents. 

## Key Features
1. **KPIs & Metrics:** Fatal, serious, and slight severity casualties, with overall casualty counts (453,051).  
2. **Trend Analysis:** Comparison of current year and previous year casualties.  
3. **Casualties by Vehicle Type:** Detailed distribution of casualties across different vehicle categories, including cars, goods vehicles, motorcycles, buses, agricultural vehicles, and others.  
4. **Casualties by Road Type & Surface:** Analysis of accidents based on road infrastructure (single carriageways, dual carriageways, slip roads, and roundabouts) and road surface conditions (dry, wet, and snowy).  
5. **Area-Wise Casualties:** Analysis of casualty distribution between rural and urban areas, reflecting the impact of urbanization, industrial activity, and higher population density in cities compared to rural regions.  
6. **Casualties by Light Conditions:** Examination of accident casualties under different lighting conditions, comparing incidents occurring in Daylight with those in Darkness to assess visibility-related risk factors.  
7. **Filter Panel:** Dynamic filters for year, accident date, weather conditions, and wind conditions, enabling users to customize views and perform targeted analysis.  

## Tools & Features Used
- **Pivot Tables** – aggregating and summarizing accident data  
- **Pivot Charts** – creating dynamic and interactive visuals  
- **Donut Charts** – percentage and proportion comparisons  
- **Line Charts** – month-wise time series trend analysis  
- **Bar Charts** – category-wise comparisons (vehicles, roads, conditions)  
- **Slicers & Filters** – enabling interactive dashboard navigation  
- **Shapes & Icons** – enhancing visual storytelling and readability  
- **Conditional Formatting** – highlighting key metrics and trends  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – ensuring structured and reliable data  
- **Dashboard Design Principles** – focusing on clarity, KPIs, and minimal design  

## Key Insights
1. **Vehicle Type Impact**  
   Cars contributed 355.6K casualties (78.5%), far exceeding goods vehicles (38.1K), bikes (37.7K), and buses (16.2K). Agricultural vehicles had the least impact (1.4K).  
2. **Accident Severity Distribution**  
   Slight severity cases dominate (378,476 | 83.5%), followed by serious accidents (66,298 | 14.6%). Fatal cases are lowest (8,277 | 1.8%) but remain the most critical safety concern.  
3. **Road Type Analysis**  
   Single carriageways reported the highest casualties (335K), over 4x more than dual carriageways (77.4K). Roundabouts (28.6K), one-way streets (8.1K), and slip roads (5K) also emerged as notable risk zones.  
4. **Area-Wise Casualties**  
   Urban areas recorded 274.3K casualties, around 53% higher than rural areas (178.7K).  

## Recommendations
1. **Enhance Road Infrastructure**  
   Single carriageways account for 335K casualties, more than four times higher than dual carriageways (77.4K). This highlights the urgent need for infrastructure improvements such as lane widening, better lighting, enhanced signage, and advanced traffic management systems.  
2. **Promote Vehicle Safety Standards**  
   Passenger cars contributed to 355.6K casualties (78.5%). Introducing stricter safety standards—such as advanced braking systems, airbags, and regular compliance checks—along with driver awareness initiatives could help lower accident severity.  
3. **Urban Traffic Management**  
   Urban areas recorded 274.3K casualties, about 53% higher than rural areas (178.7K). Implementing smart traffic systems, pedestrian-friendly crossings, and congestion-reduction strategies could help improve safety.  
4. **Weather & Surface-Specific Measures**  
   Wet road surfaces accounted for 138.6K casualties, nearly half the number recorded on dry roads (298.4K). Enhancing drainage, conducting resurfacing, and raising driver awareness on braking distances could help reduce accidents.  
5. **Targeted Awareness Campaigns**  
   Daylight conditions recorded 326.7K casualties, which is over 160% higher than those in darkness (126.3K). Focused campaigns on distracted driving, speed management, and pedestrian safety during daylight could help reduce these risks.  

## Conclusion
This project showcases how Excel can be used to analyse large-scale road accident data, uncover key risk factors, and provide actionable insights with recommendations that could support safer roads and informed decision-making.
